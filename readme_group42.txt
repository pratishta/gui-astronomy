There are several ways to run our code. We recommend simply running the jar file that we have submitted. Alternatively, you can compile and run src/gui/astronomy/GUIAstronomy.java. You can also simply open the directory as a project in Eclipse, and run it from there.

Scroll sideways on your mousepad in the weather data section in the hourly view to see the weather in later hours. Press shift to toggle between the smaller (iPhone) and larger (iPad) views. 

We used the JavaFX library to create the interactive prototype, building the interface and handling user interactions with UI elements. We also used an open source Java library for the Forecast.io API (https://github.com/dvdme/forecastio-lib-java) to obtain current weather data, which we use to populate the data within our prototype. Additionally, we used the Google Gson library (https://github.com/google/gson) along with the Google Maps API in order to obtain the coordinates for specific locations, which allowed us to obtain location-specific weather data.
