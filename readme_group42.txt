We used the JavaFX library to create the interactive prototype, building the interface and handling user interactions with UI elements. We also used an open source Java library for the Forecast.io API (https://github.com/dvdme/forecastio-lib-java) to obtain current weather data, which we use to populate the data within our prototype. Additionally, we used the Google Gson library (https://github.com/google/gson) along with the Google Maps API in order to obtain the coordinates for specific locations, which allowed us to obtain location-specific weather data.
